# You have been given a robot with very basic capabilities:

# It can move left or right.
# It can pick up an item
# If it tries to pick up an item while already holding one, it will swap the items instead.
# It can compare the item it's holding to the item in front of it.
# It can switch a light on its head on or off.
# Your task is to program this robot to sort lists using ONLY these abilities.

# Rules
# Inside the Robot_Sort directory you'll find the robot_sort.py file. Open it up and read through each of the robot's abilities.
# Once you've understood those, start filling out the sort() method following these rules:

# You may use any pre-defined robot methods.
# You may NOT modify any pre-defined robot methods.
# You may use logical operators. (if, and, or, not, etc.)
# You may use comparison operators. ( > , >= , < , <= , == , is, etc.)
# You may use iterators. (while, for, break, continue)
# You may NOT store any variables. (=)
# You may NOT access any instance variables directly. (self._anything)
# You may NOT use any Python libraries or class methods. (sorted(), etc.)
# You may define robot helper methods, as long as they follow all the rules.

# Make sure you understand the problem and all of the rules! A solution that breaks the rules will receive no credit.

# If you're unsure if an operator or method is allowed, ask.

# Lay out some numbered cards in a line and try sorting them as if you were the robot.

# Come up with a plan and write out your algorithm before coding. If your plan is sound but you don't reach a working implementation in three hours, you may receive partial credit.

# There is no efficiency requirement but you may lose points for an unreasonably slow solution. Tests should run in far less than 1 second.

# We discussed a sorting method this week that might be useful. Which one?

# The robot has exactly one bit of memory: its light. Why is this important?

# Algorithim plan:
# The algorithim necessary for this challenge seems closest to the bubble-sort algorithim. We need the light as a store for our binary
# operator, sort_occured, which will keep the robot sorting through the array until we have successfully sorted through the whole array
# We start the robot with the light on. Then, we enter the loop, and then immediately turn the light off, so if there are no swaps
# during the current traversal of the array, it stays off, and can exit the loop after its current iteration.
# We then have the robot go through the array from the left side, comparing the item on its left
# to the item on its right. If the item on the left is greater than the right, we swap, AND we turn on the `swap` light, if its not on.
# Then we move the robot to the right, and continue the process until we hit len(array - 2), or the the index right before the last index.
# Compare, swap if necessary, and then continue the loop if and ONLY if the swap light is on.
# If all goes well, after the last loop through the array, it will exit the loop and return the sorted array.
# So, that's the plan. Let's try it out!
